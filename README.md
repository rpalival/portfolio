# My Portfolio Website
Boiler plate created using vite-react.

# Here's a summary of the tech stack and libraries I used in my project:
1. Vite: This is my build tool. It's used for building the project and running the development server.
2. React: This is my main framework.
3. React DOM: This is used alongside React to render my components to the DOM.
4. Framer Motion: This library I used for animations in my React application.
5. GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform): This is another library I used for creating animations. It's very powerful and flexible, and can be used alongside Framer Motion.
6. Lodash: This is a utility library that provides helpful methods for working with arrays, objects, numbers, etc. but I used it to throttle my rendering functions.
7. Matter.js: This is a 2D physics engine for the web. I used to create a nice little container, do check it out.
8. React Icons: This library provides a wide variety of icons that can be used in your React components.
9. React Parallax and React Parallax Tilt: These libraries I used to add parallax effects to my components.
10. @react-three/fiber and @react-three/drei: These libraries I used for creating 3D graphics using React and Three.js
11. @emailjs/browser: This library is used for sending emails from my application.

Quite a diverse tech stack but I am gonna list down all the references and inspirations I have used, covering a wide range of functionalities from 3D graphics to animations, drag-and-drop, and email sending.
